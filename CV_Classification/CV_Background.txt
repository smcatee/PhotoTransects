Notes for cropping w/ OpenCV
	close example https://docs.opencv.org/trunk/db/d00/samples_2cpp_2squares_8cpp-example.html#a20

bilateralFilter - a pixel smoothing (blurring) function that attempts to not smooth away edges
	filter - window of coefficients sliding across an image, filtering(modifying) the pixels by that coefficent
	kernel - coefficients of the filter

erode and dilate
	for removing noise, isolate or join elements in image, find intensity of bumps/holes
	applies a 'structuring element' to image
	dilation - kernel scans over image and finds maximum value, then replaces all pixels w/ that value
		lighter pixels dilate over darker pixels
	erosion - kernel scans over for local minimum, replaces all w/ that value
		darker pixels erode over lighter pixels

canny edge detection	
	uses sobel kernel to find image gradients
	edge detection within a threshold maxVal and minVal
	cv2.Canny(img, maxVal, minVal)

contours
	a curve at boundary of all areas of same color or intensity
	useful for shape analysis, object detection and recognition
	object found should be white, and background black
	first apply threshold or canny edge detection
	cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE
		saves only beginning and end of lines, rather than all points on line
	contour features
		moment - weighted average of pixels to detect characteristics, e.g. center
		contour area - cv2.contourArea(cnt)
		contour perimeter - (arc length) cv2.arcLength(cnt,True)
		contour approximation - reduces contour shape vertices based on specifications, e.g. finding square!
			uses Ramer–Douglas–Peucker algorithm
			elipson - max distance from contour to approximated contour
				epsilon = 0.1*cv.arcLength(cnt,True)
				approx = cv.approxPolyDP(cnt,epsilon,True)
		convex hull - removes/reduces convex curves
		check convexity - cv.isContourConvex(cnt)
		Bounding Rectangles
			straight bounding rectangle - vertical/horizontal lines
			rotated rectangle - minimizes area
			minimum enclosing circle
			fit ellipse
			fit line

steps:
	grayscale, dilate, keep high values up while strongly pulling low values down, canny edge, contour approx
